## My process

I studied W3 Schools HTML & CSS courses. I also looked at a couple of other students solutions to see how they approached different aspects of the challenge.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a great hands on example of how to create a simple HTML page from scratch. Previously I edited other pages but never created one from the beginning.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools HTML course](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - This gave me a full understanding of HTML and the parts I was not aware of.
- [W3 Schools CSS course](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This was my first CSS course. I loved the "Try it yourself" sections that allow you to edit the CSS and see the results.
